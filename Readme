This app asks the user multiple-choice questions and keeps track of the score. The game provides feedback on whether the user’s answer is correct and shows the final score at the end.

How the Code Works

Run Quiz: run_quiz() function loops through each question, displays it with options, and collects the user’s answer.
Check Answers: Compares the user’s answer with the correct answer, increments the score if correct, and provides feedback.
Display Final Score: At the end of the quiz, it shows the user’s total score.
